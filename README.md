# DL-Defect-Detection
This repository focuses on enhancing model accuracy for defect detection using deep learning frameworks. By developing a multi-layer encoder-decoder architecture, it effectively extracts and reconstructs significant features from a limited dataset. Utilizing TensorFlow or PyTorch, the project aims to provide robust solutions for small datasets, ensuring efficient training and accurate results. Key features include deep learning-based defect detection, feature extraction and reconstruction, and optimized handling of limited data. To get started, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the model.
